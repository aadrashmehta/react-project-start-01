# React Project Start 🚀

This is a **basic beginner React project** created to help you understand the **core concepts** of React — **Components**, **State**, and **Props**.  
It’s a great starting point if you’re new to React and want to practice building simple, reusable UI elements.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

### 1. Components
- Components are the **building blocks** of a React application.  
- Each component is like a small, reusable piece of UI (for example: a button, card, or input field).  
- You’ll learn how to:
  - Create functional components.
  - Combine multiple components together to form a full app.

### 2. Props (Properties)
- Props are **inputs** passed from one component to another.  
- They help you make components **reusable** and **dynamic**.  
- You’ll see how to:
  - Pass data from a parent component to a child component.
  - Display that data dynamically in the UI.

### 3. State
- State is used to **store and manage data** that can change over time.  
- It makes your components **interactive**.  
- You’ll learn how to:
  - Use the `useState` hook.
  - Update the UI automatically when the state changes.
